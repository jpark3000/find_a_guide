# City Bird

## Description

This is a fork of a project that I was working on with a couple friends that died out, at least for the time being.

This is a [link](https://github.com/jpark3000/find_a_guide) to the original repository.

The purpose of this fork is to expand on this project through my own efforts, and to explore exciting new technologies.
